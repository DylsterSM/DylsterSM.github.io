    <p class ="wc-bio-p1">I'm a 28 year old single father with a passion for psychology, eastern philosophy, music and mostly everything art. It's always been one of my largest goals in life to create positive impact and change through my art and connecting with others. After several years of working in logistics i decided to continue my education by studying game design. My goal is to channel my passion for psychology and philosophy with my love of game experiences and art in a multi-disciplinary approach creating experiences to enrich the lives of others. As i have grown older i have grown increasingly interested in the ways psychology and technology overlap. It is my hope to eventually conduct post-graduate research on this overlap in an attempt to better understand technology's impact on the human condition.  </p>
